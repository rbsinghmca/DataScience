it is advisable to convert such feature values into categorical string values before proceeding with model building

0 and 1 indicating the years 2018 and 2019 respectively
 
done with model building and residual analysis and have made predictions on the test set
  
just make sure you use the following two lines of code to calculate the R-squared score on the test set.

from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

A reasonable number of different models are attempted and the best one is chosen based on key performance metrics.

Residual analysis is performed after model building and the assumptions are validated.

Model evaluation is done using the correct principles and appropriate evaluation metrics are chosen.

The model is interpreted and explained correctly. 
The commented code includes a brief explanation of the important variables and the model in simple terms.








from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
gle = LabelEncoder()
genre_labels = gle.fit_transform(vg_df['Genre'])
genre_mappings = {index: label for index, label in 
                  enumerate(gle.classes_)}
genre_mappings













Submissions Expected:

Python Notebook: One Python notebook with the whole linear model, predictions, and evaluation.
Subjective Questions PDF: Apart from the Python notebook, you also need to answer some subjective questions related to linear regression which can be downloaded from the file below. Answer these questions and submit it as a PDF. 
Note: There are some questions in the subjective questions doc that

 you might not be familiar with. So you're expected to research these questions and give an appropriate answer in order to expand your learnings of this topic.
